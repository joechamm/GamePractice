# GamePractice
Project to practice in Game Development. For now it's dummy project that doesn't do any usefull.

It is recommend to use build scripts to build project:
```
// Build scripts location
~: cd Sources/Build/Automation

// Build project in Debug & Run unittests
~: python build.py -build=Debug -test
```
However you can CMD if you familiar with cmake. The root CMakeList file located in 

```
~: cd Sources/Code
```

Please note, that this will not build 3rd party dependcies to run build target and you should do it by yourself.
